- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @stsibikov, a junior Data Scientist with experience in data analytics, ML, DL and NLP.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in becoming a Data Scientist with a heavy focus on building ML/DL models.
- ðŸŒ± I am focusing on expanding my Kaggle/DS community presence (competitions).
- :construction: for my next project, I will combine tabular, textual and imagery data to predict prices of a vital commodity. The design for the project is already drafted according to my previous works, and some specifics can be seen at [this repo](https://github.com/stsibikov/price_prediction).
