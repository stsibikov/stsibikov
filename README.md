ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @stsibikov, a Data Scientist with professional experience as a data analyst (+2 years) and personal experience implementing ML/DL models (+3 years), gained through pet projects, courses and participation in Kaggle competitions. I also have ML service design skills and know how to turn a business problem into a successful service.

I am looking for a job in the field of Data Science, which involves implementation of machine learning models.

Key skills: SQL, Python (pandas, pyspark, sklearn, pytorch etc), MLOps (airflow, mlflow)

ðŸŒ± Currently, I am focusing on expanding my Kaggle/DS community presence (competitions).
:factory: for my next project, I will combine tabular, textual and imagery data to predict prices of a vital commodity. The design for the project is already drafted according to my previous works, and some specifics can be seen at [this repo](https://github.com/stsibikov/price_prediction).
