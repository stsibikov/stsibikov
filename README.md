- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @stsibikov, a data scientist based in Moscow.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in finding new ways of using ML to benefit society and businesses.
- ðŸŒ± After a little pause, I will be focusing on building new projects to showcase my DS, DL and CV knowledge
- :building_construction: for my next project, I will combine tabular, textual and imagery data to predict prices of a vital commodity. The design for the project is already drafted according to my previous works, and the specifics can be seen at [this repo](https://github.com/stsibikov/price_prediction)
